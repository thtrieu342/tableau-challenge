# Citi Bike Data Visualization

## About
The New York Citi Bike Program is the largest bike sharing program in the United States. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage. While the data is regularly updated, there has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. The purpose of this project is to put together a storyboard that visualizes some of the Citi Bike data to help find ways to improve the bike program.

## Data Source: 
The csv dataset can be found in the [Resources](https://github.com/thtrieu342/tableau-challenge/tree/main/Resources) folder of this repository. Data is from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html).

## Data Visualization:
Data Visualizations can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/toni5386/viz/CitiBikeAnalysisHomework_16240656410610/Story1) on my Tableau Public.

###### Tableau storyboard includes:
- Top 10 start stations
- Bottom 10 start stations
- Number of casual and member riders
- Popular start stations for casual and member riders
- Peak hours (military time) for casual and member riders

## Analysis:
- Peak hours for both casual and member riders are pretty similar.
- Popular Start stations are similar among casual and member riders.
- There are more member riders than casual riders.
